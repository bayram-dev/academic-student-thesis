@Article{PerformanceAnaSharma2002,
  Abstract = {<jats:p>In this article we consider a finite queue with its arrivals controlled by the random early detection algorithm. This is one of the most prominent congestion avoidance schemes in
the Internet routers. The aggregate arrival stream from the population of transmission control protocol sources is locally considered stationary renewal or Markov modulated Poisson process with
general packet length distribution. We study the exact dynamics of this queue and provide the stability and the rates of convergence to the stationary distribution and obtain the packet loss
probability and the waiting time distribution. Then we extend these results to a two traffic class case with each arrival stream renewal. However, computing the performance indices for this system
becomes computationally prohibitive. Thus, in the latter half of the article, we approximate the dynamics of the average queue length process asymptotically via an ordinary differential equation. We
estimate the error term via a diffusion approximation. We use these results to obtain approximate transient and stationary performance of the system. Finally, we provide some computational examples to
show the accuracy of these approximations.</jats:p>},
